# Controls
```
Space       : pause/play the sorting algorithm
W           : move forward one step through the algorithm (when paused)
R           : randomize the array
<- ->       : cycle through sorting algorithms
arrow up    : sort in ascending order
arrow down  : sort in descending order
numpd PLUS  : increment array size by 1
numpd MINUS : decrement array size by 1
```

## How to Use
If you are on a Windows machine, you are in luck! You don't need to have Rust installed on your machine at all to run this project. All you have to do is go to SortingAlgorithms/target/debug and download SortingAlgorithms.exe, then run that and you should see a funny little algorithm chugging away.

For Linux users, or other operating systems that don't support .exe, you will have to download the whole project yourself, and build it using cargo. Cargo builds differently on different operating systems, and since I've done this on Windows my precompiled exe will not work on Linux machines. Sorry ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
